meow (0.9.11)
    * More aggressive mp3 parsing makes it more likely to play certain malformed
      files
    * Non-KDE version: you can now replace all the icons (in KDE, the normal
      icon theme applies.
    * Data and config is stored in ~/.config/meowplayer.org (Unix) and
      c:\users\whatever\meowplayer.org (Windows) instead of the old location
      (the directory is "meow"). Also collections are stored in a new
      "collections" subfolder. This is a backwards incompatible change, but you
      can manually move the files if you want

    * Qt version on Unix: "media" keys now work globally. In later versions,
      you'll be able to configure them
    * Non-KDE version: Cosmetic changes to the About box
